- Monitoring and Control System for autonomous drones
- System supports 3 types of communication:
	- Control Commands (UDP) 
		Central server to drones
		Minimal delay	
	- Telemetry Data (TCP)
		Drone to server
		Location, speed, status
		Data must be reliable and delivered
		In order delivery
	- File Transfers (QUIC)
		Send large files
		Require protocol
		Low latency and high reliability
		example QUIC
OBJECTIVE: Client and server application with 3 mode of communication
- since multiple drones => unique identifier
